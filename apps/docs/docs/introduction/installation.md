To get started with `nest-commander` you can either add it to a `nest new` project, created using the `@nestjs/cli`, or you can set the project up from scratch and make sure to install `nest-commander`, `@nestjs/common` and `@nestjs/core`.

```sh
npm i nest-commander
# OR
yarn add nest-commander
# OR
pnpm i nestjs-commander
```

:::note Soon there will be a schematic for scaffolding an entire CLI application. Keep an eye out for it. :::
