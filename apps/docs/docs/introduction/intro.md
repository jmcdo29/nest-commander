[NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com) is a super powerful NodeJS framework that allows developers to have the same architecture across all their applications. But other than the mention of [Standalone Applications](https://docs.nestjs.com/standalone-applications) there's only a few packages that attempt to bring together Nest's opinionated architecture and popular CLI packages. `nest-commander` aims to bring the most unified experience when it comes to being inline with Nest's ideologies and opinions, by wrapping the popular [Commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) and [Inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) packages, and providing its own decorators for integration with all the corresponding libraries.
