So now you know about this awesome package and want quick ways to set up commands and questions and tie them to each other. You could write your own shell script, or use handlebars and some clever generation of code, maybe even write your own schematic, but why go through all that trouble when one already exists? Simply install the `nest-commander-schematics` collection as a `devDependency`

```shell
npm i -D nest-commander-schematics
yarn add -D nest-commander-schematics
pnpm i -D nest-commander-schematics
```
