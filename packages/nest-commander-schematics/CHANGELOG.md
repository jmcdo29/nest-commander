# nest-commander-schematics

## 1.0.0
### Major Changes

- 28cc116: Releases two schematics for the angular and nest CLI's to make use of `command` and `question`. To use one, you can pass `--collection nest-commander-schematic` to Nest's CLI and then the schematic name followed by the name of the feature. e.g. `nest g --collection nest-commander-schematics command foo`.
