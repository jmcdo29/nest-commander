# nest-commander

## 2.3.4

## 2.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 8285a98: missing config file warning doesn't show

## 2.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 3c43005: fix: move plugin error code to onModuleInit

## 2.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 478c0d9: Make commands built with `usePlugins: true` not exit on non-found config file, just log extra data when an error happens

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6c9eaa3: Commands can now be built with the expectation of reading in plugins to dynamically modify the CLI

  By using the `usePlugins` option for the `CommandFactory`, the built CLI can expect to find a configuration file at `nest-commander.json` (or several others, check the docs) to allow for users to plug commands in after the CLI is built.

- 13723bd: Subcommands can now be created

  There's a new decorator, `@SubCommand()` for creating nested commands like `docker compose up`. There's also a new option on `@Command()` (`subCommands`) for setting up this sub command relationship.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3831e52: Adds a new `@Help()` decorator for custom commander help output

  `nest-commander-testing` now also uses a `hex` instead of `utf-8` encoding when creating a random js file name during the `CommandTestFactory` command. This is to help create more predictable output names.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6df8964: Adds in a new metadata option for the @Option() decorator to make the option required, just like a required argument

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- ee001cc: Upgrade all Nest dependencies to version 8

  WHAT: Upgrade `@nestjs/` dependencies to v8 and RxJS to v7 WHY: To support the latest version of Nest HOW: upgrading to Nest v8 should be all that's necessary (along with rxjs to v7)

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f3f687b: Allow for commands to be run indefinitely

  There is a new `runWithoutClosing` method in the `CommandFactory` class. This command allows for not having the created Nest Application get closed immediately, which should allow for the use of indefinitely runnable commands.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7cce284: Add ability to use error handler for commander errors

  Within the `CommandFactory.run()` now as a second parameter you can either keep passing just the logger, or you can pass in an object with the logger and an `errorHandler`. Ths `errorHandler` is a method that takes in an `Error` and returns `void`. The errorHandler will be passed to commander's `exitOverride` method, if it exists. This is useful for better handling errors and giving the dev more control over what is seen. There is also no longer an `unhandledPromiseRejection` on empty commands.
